# Snowfox AI Pitch (Not a Hackathon)

## Use Case
Fix shitty client data.

## How does it all work?
- Take shitty client data (text, spreadsheet) and input it into app
- Tell the app how much you love it or hate it in order to GLAZE the AI model
- Enter in any additional prompt information (what to exactly do with the data)
